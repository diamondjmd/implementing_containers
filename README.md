# implementing Containers
Basic implementation of two dynamically sized containers, sequential and a list type. A custom code demonstrating the capabilities of these containers.

1. Serial container
A distinctive feature of such a container is the arrangement of elements one after another in a row
(like a regular C-style array).
2. List type container â€“ does not provide guarantees for the arrangement of elements one after another
in memory. Communication between elements is carried out through pointers (a pointer to the
previous element and/or a pointer to the next element).
The user code (called from the main function) should contain the following set of actions with both containers:
