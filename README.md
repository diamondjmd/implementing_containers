# Implementing Containers
This project involves the basic implementation of three dynamically sized containers: a sequential container (Vector) and two list types (List and Forward_list). The custom classes aim to showcase the capabilities of these containers.

- Sequential Container
A distinctive feature of this container is the arrangement of elements one after another in a row, similar to a regular C-style array.

- List Type Container
This container does not guarantee the arrangement of elements one after another in memory. Communication between elements is facilitated through pointers, including a pointer to the previous element and/or a pointer to the next element.
